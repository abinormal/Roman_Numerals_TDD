# Roman_Numerals_TDD
Exercise to use TDD (Test Driven Design) practices to write test code before 
the implementation.

### Limitations
When numbers got higher than 3000 the Romans would start over at the
bottom but add an over line (macron) above the letter to show it's worth 1000
For example IV means 4 but with a macron it's 4000.

I need to work out how to display a macron to display larger numbers.
